# League of Legends Skill Chart - User Guide

Make a shareable image that shows how you rate yourself **by lane** and **by class** in League.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Open the page.**
   You’ll see two lists: **Lanes** (Top, Jungle, Mid, Bot, Support, Fill) and **Classes** (Controller, Fighter, Mage, Marksman, Slayer, Tank, Specialist).

2. **(Optional) Enter a display name.**
   Add your Riot ID (or any name) at the top. It appears as a sub-line in the exported image.

3. **Pick your ranks.**
   Use the dropdown next to each lane/class. The big crest on the right updates instantly.

4. **Export or Copy.**

   * **Export PNG** downloads a 1920×1080 image.
   * **Copy to clipboard** places the image directly into your clipboard (supported browsers only).

5. **Share it.**
   Post the image on X/Twitter, Discord, Reddit, etc.

## Helpful Bits

* **Randomize**: fills everything with random ranks (for fun or testing).
* **Reset**: sets everything back to Gold and clears the display name.
* **Tooltips on classes**: hover the small **i** to see a short description + example champions + link to the official wiki.

## Tips for Best Results

* Keep your browser at **100% zoom** before exporting for consistent rendering.
* Very long display names may wrap...shorter looks cleaner.

## FAQ

**Does the site store my name or ranks?**
No, everything is rendered client-side.

**Can I change the background?**
The exported image uses a fixed wallpaper to keep the style consistent.

**My clipboard copy doesn’t work. Why?**
Some browsers or system settings block clipboard writes. Use **Export PNG** instead.

**Can I use this on mobile?**
Yes, but desktop gives more space and the export is more reliable.
